My name is Klaas Lee and I am an undergraduate at Sun Yat-sen University. My research interests include data mining and machine learning. I started stklaas to share my experience about deep learning and data mining. As I am still learning myself, there should be some errors in my posts. You are welcomed to point out any of them in my blog.

### More Information

Learning is a long trace that will never end!
